# Bike Sharing Assignment
> The aim of this project is to analyse and build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand of shared bikes.

## General Information
A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service in the United States, aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people and the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes.

Objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
